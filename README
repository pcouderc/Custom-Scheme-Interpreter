# Original README

DO NOT place anything in the Parser folder, or alter it at all.
If you place .ml files in there, they may be deleted by the scripts.


Windows users:

Build the interpreter by running the file build.bat.

If you ever want to delete all the compiled files in order to
build from scratch, you can run clean.bat.


Mac/Linux users:

Build the interpreter by using the command:

    sh build.sh

If you want to delete compiled files and build from scratch, run:

    sh clean.sh

We have also included a makefile. You are free to use that instead
if you know how to.
